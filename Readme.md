# ElementIoT.Particle

The Particle solution contains the projects resposible for the infrastructure and operational aspects that make up the base of the domain contexts represented in the other, elemental based, solutions.

Examples of the patters that the Infrastructure is resposible for are: CQRS, Messging Patterns, Deployment and Setup Scripts, and classes that represent base concept from which classes in other projects derive from.

Examples of the patterns that the Operational is resposible for are: Configuration, Error Handling, Logging and Tracing, Shared Utilities, Validation and Security.
